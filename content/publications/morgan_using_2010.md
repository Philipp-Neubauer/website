The purpose of most translocation projects is to preserve endangered species or
restore the ecosystem of an area. In comparison this translocation is being used
as a research tool, though it is hoped that the knowledge gained will help future
conservation efforts. It is part of a wider set of research projects being
undertaken by staff and post-graduate students at Massey University. The main
pre-requisite for re-introduction is usually to reverse the habitat factors causing
the initial loss of the species. However, in fragmented habitats, it is possible that
species' distribution may be reduced by failure to re-colonize following chance
extinctions, i.e., due to meta-population dynamics. In such cases, it may be
possible to increase the distribution of the species through translocation alone.
The main purpose of the translocations described in this case study was to
develop methods for assessing whether translocation can be used to counter the
effect of fragmentation. North Island (*Petroica longipes*) robins were used to trial
this idea because; they are relatively easy to monitor and handle, they are found
in a suitable study area (fragmented forest habitat in the central North Island of
New Zealand), they are not currently considered to be endangered (although they
have disappeared from most of their original range), and source robins for
translocation were available in nearby commercial pine plantations which were due to be
felled.
