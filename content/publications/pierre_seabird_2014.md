In New Zealand waters, bottom longlining is conducted by vessels with 
diverse characteristics, both physical (e.g., vessel size) and operational
(e.g., manual lining versus using autoline systems). Typically, bottom-longline
fisheries are considered in two groups: inshore fisheries, involving
small vessels deploying hand-baited hooks and targeting a mix of species
including snapper (*Pagrus auratus*), bluenose (*Hyperoglyphe antarctica*),
and hapuku/bass (*Polyprion oxygeneios*, *P. americanus*), and large deepwater
vessels that use auto-line systems, typically operate at considerable
distances offshore and target ling (*Genypterus blacodes*) (e.g., Ramm 2010,
2012, Pierre et al. 2013).
