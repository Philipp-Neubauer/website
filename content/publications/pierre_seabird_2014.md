In New Zealand waters, bottom longlining is conducted by vessels with
diverse characteristics, both physical (e.g., vessel size) and operational
(e.g., manual lining versus using autoline systems). Typically, bottom-longline
fisheries are considered in two groups: inshore fisheries, involving
small vessels deploying hand-baited hooks and targeting a mix of species
including snapper (*Pagrus auratus*), bluenose (*Hyperoglyphe antarctica*),
and hapuku/bass (*Polyprion oxygeneios*, *P. americanus*), and large deepwater
vessels that use auto-line systems, typically operate at considerable
distances offshore and target ling (*Genypterus blacodes*) (e.g., Ramm 2010,
2012, Pierre et al. 2013). Nevertheless, an additional component of the
bottom-longline fishing fleet comprises middle-sized vessels that often operate in deeper water, and target species such as ling, bluenose, ribaldo
(*Mora moro*) and sea perch (*Helicolenus* spp.).

Fishing operations using bottom longlines catch seabirds due to the birds'
propensity to forage on baits, fish processing waste, and fish retrieved
during hauling. Factors such as slow longline sink rates, the incidental
discharge of bait scraps during auto-baiting, and discarding of used baits
on hauling exacerbate this bycatch risk. At the same time, there are effective
methods available to reduce seabird bycatch risk in bottom-longline fishing
operations, including the use of streamer (tori) lines, line weighting, and
discharge retention (Bull 2007, Lokkeborg 2011).

Amongst bottom-longline vessels in New Zealand waters, both the highest
risk to seabirds and the greatest uncertainty in risk estimation have been
linked to vessels less than 34 m in length that target species other than
snapper or bluenose (Richard & Abraham 2013c). Within this sector of the
bottom-longline fleet, seabirds of particular conservation concern that have
been reported caught are Chatham albatross (*Thalassarche eremita*), Salvin's
albatross (*T. salvini*), black petrel (*Procellaria parkinsoni*) and flesh-footed
shearwater (*Puffinus carneipes*) (Richard & Abraham 2013c).
Vessels less than 34 m in length that target bluenose reflect the next highest
risk to seabirds, followed by larger vessels (i.e., greater than 34 m length).
Seabirds associated with the risks by these other vessel groups include
eight species of albatross, and also black petrel and flesh-footed shearwater
(Richard & Abraham 2013c).

Here, we report on the Department of Conservation's (DOC) Conservation
Services Programme (CSP) project MIT2013-03. The aim of this project was
to characterise bottom-longline fishing activity by middle-sized and large
vessels operating in deeper water in relation to seabird captures. Also
included in this study was the identification of factors associated with high
seabird bycatch risk of these middle-sized vessels.
