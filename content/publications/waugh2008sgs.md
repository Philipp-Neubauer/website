Global variations of stirring in the surface ocean are
quantified using finite-time Lyapunov exponents (FTLEs)
calculated from currents derived from satellite altimetry. It is
shown that the stirring is highly non-uniform, and the
probability distribution functions (PDFs) of the FTLEs are
broad, asymmetric, and have long high-stretch tails. The
characteristics of the PDFs vary with mesoscale activity and
integration time: There are larger values and broader PDFs
in regions of high strain rates and eddy kinetic energy
(EKE), e.g., western boundary currents and the Antarctic
Circumpolar Current, and for shorter integration times. The
PDFs have a near-universal relationship with the mean
strain of a region, and are reasonably well fit by Weibull
distributions. The above variations in the stirring may help
our understanding of the distribution and spatial
heterogeneities of biogeochemical tracers, and raise the
possibility of developing a parameterization of the stirring
based on the, easily-calculated, EKE.
