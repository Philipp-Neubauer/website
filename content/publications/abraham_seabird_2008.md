This report contains an analysis of data on seabird warp strike collected by fisheries observers. The survey was carried out in the Auckland Islands squid fishery (SQU6T/1T) over the summer of 2004â€”2005. The key results are listed below. - 904 good observations were made from 526 separate tows, on 19 different vessels - 789 large bird heavy contacts were observed, at an average rate of 3.5 heavy contacts per hour (c. v. 9%) - The number of small bird heavy contacts was lower, with 306 contacts over the entire survey. This corresponds to an average rate of 1.4 per hour (c. v. 12%) - Offal discharge was the most significant factor associated with large bird strikes - Discharging offal increased the large-bird strike rate by an estimated factor of 6, compared with no offal discharge - The strike-rate for large-birds decreased by an estimated factor of 2 when bird bafflers were used - Higher small-bird strikes were observed at higher discharge rates, and the small-bird strike rates were not strongly dependent on discharge type - Less than half of the vessels observed used bird bafflers. More than half of the vessels discharged offal on more than 20% of the tows - A total of 106 dead or injured birds were recovered from the tows, a rate of 0.2 birds per tow (c. v. 13%) - The discharge of offal was the factor most significantly associated with the recovery of dead and injured birds from the warps - Recovery of dead or injured birds from the warp was significantly associated with the warp strike rate
