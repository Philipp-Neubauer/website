This research talk presents the findings from a fishdown experiment of pāua *Haliotis iris* that involved the use of dive loggers.  The dive loggers were introduced in New Zealand commercial pāua fisheries in 2010 to provide high-resolution spatial data of catch per unit effort for the management of pāua stocks.
