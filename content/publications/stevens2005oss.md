Current-meter, temperature, and microstructure observations of the large-amplitude internal tide shoaling on the continental shelf of the east coast of northern New Zealand show the complexity of the internal kinematics and mixing. The propagation speed of the main internal wave was around 0.3 m s<sup>-1</sup>, and nonstationary time series analysis was used to locate the trailing short-wavelength internal waves in frequency (periods of around 40 min) and tidal-phase space. The average energy dissipation rate (5 Ã— 10<sup>-8</sup> m<sup>2</sup> s<sup>-3</sup>) was an order of magnitude smaller than that observed on the open shelf in other studies, but peaks in dissipation rate were measured to be much greater. The vertical diffusivity of heat was around 10<sup>-4</sup> m<sup>2</sup> s<sup>-1</sup>, comparable to, or greater than, other studies. Examples of the scale and sporadic nature of larger mixing events were observed. The behavior was complicated by the nearby steeply shoaling coast of the Poor Knight Islands. Consistent reflected wave energy was not apparent.
