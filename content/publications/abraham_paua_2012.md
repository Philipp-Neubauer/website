Pāua (primarily *Haliotis iris*) fisheries in New Zealand are currently managed
in Quota Management Areas (QMAs). An further assumption used in paua stock
assessment is that catch per unit effort (CPUE) provides an index of
abundance There are several key problems that can confound the relationship
between haliotid CPUE and abundance. In particular, abalone are vulnerable to
serial depletion where accessible paua are fished initially, but there is a
progression of fishing to other reefs with a similar CPUE once the accessible
paua have been harvested. 

In addition, management of p ¯ aua is hampered by the limitations of current data collection that only gives aggregate data at a
statistical area and daily scale.  To address these issues, paua loggers were
introduced into the New Zealand commercial fishery in October 2010. The
loggers are compact units that fit in a pocket on the back of a diver's
wetsuit. When the diver is at the surface they record their position, using a
GPS, and when they are underwater the loggers record the diver's depth. A unit
is also kept on the boat, and is used to record the location and time of catch
bags being brought onboard.  

In order to help develop methods for interpreting
the paua logger data, a fishdown experiment was carried out in Fighting Bay
(in the outer Marlborough Sounds) in the summer of 2011—12. Fighting Bay was
closed to all fishing in 1996, and so has a high paua abundance. During the
fishdown, a designated area within Fighting Bay was repeatedly fished, using
commercial paua divers, until the catch per unit effort was reduced to levels
similar to a fished control site. Paua loggers were used during the experiment
to monitor changes in CPUE over a wide range of paua abundance. Fishing was
also carried out at Boat Harbour, a nearby fished site.  

Catch per unit
effort was measured using the loggers in two different ways: firstly, from the
time that divers spent underwater (20 cm or more below the surface), and
secondly by summing the half-hour blocks during which fishing activity is
recorded on the boat loggers. The first measure was derived from the dive data
and would allow effort to be mapped at a fine spatial scale, while the second
measure is only dependent on data from the boat loggers. Over the course of the
fishdown, a linear relationship between CPUE and cumulative catch was seen for
both measures. This is consistent with a constant catchability.  Depletion
models were fitted to the data, with a separate catchability for each diver.
The resulting models fitted the data well, with the c.v.'s of the model fitted
using the underwater and fishing-time measures of effort being 0.17 and 0.10,
respectively. It is striking that the simpler measure of effort fitted the
catch data more closely. During the fishdown, 8 t of paua were harvested from
Fighting Bay. Using the fishing-time measure of effort, the depletion model
estimated that there were 3 (2.3 to 3.9) t of harvestable paua remaining at
the end of the experiment.  

Exploration of the data shows the power of the
loggers to quantify the detailed distribution of the catch.  The catch over the
course of the experiment was mapped in 10 m<sup>2</sup> squares, with one of these 0.01 ha
squares having a catch of 221 kg. In Fighting Bay, the hectare with the highest
catch yielded 4635 kg (the actual yield would have been higher as, due to
problems with the dive logger GPS units, only 64% of the catch was spatially
mapped). It was expected that during the fishdown divers would move to deeper
water. No consistent change in the depth or duration of the dives was seen. Swim distances were variable,
and no consistent change in the swim distance associated with dives (either on the surface or underwater)
was seen. The other indicator that showed a marked change was shell length-frequency. Harvesting was
size selective, with the larger paua being preferentially harvested. On the first day in Fighting Bay, 2.7% 
of the shells had a basal length less than 130 mm, and on the final day 28.8% of the shells were less than
this threshold.

The Fighting Bay data will be a valuable dataset for the future development of indices of paua stock 
status. In this report we have carried out an exploratory analysis. There are more avenues that could
be fruitfully explored. The next priority for analysis of the logger data, is to develop indices of spatial
movement of the divers. There was evidence during the experiment that divers moved more slowly when
catches were higher, and more rapidly when catches were lower. These spatial patterns have not yet been
quantified.
