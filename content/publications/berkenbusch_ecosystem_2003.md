The concept of ecosystem engineering has been proposed recently to account for key processes
between organisms and their environment which are not directly trophic or competitive, and which result in the
modification, maintenance and/or creation of habitats. Since the initial reporting of the idea, little work has been
undertaken to apply the proposed concept to potential ecosystem engineers in the marine environment.
Biological and ecological data for the burrowing ghost shrimp *Callianassa filholi* (Decapoda: Thalassinidea)
allowed for a formal assessment of this species as an ecosystem engineer, in direct accordance with published
criteria. Despite a low population density and the short durability of its burrow structures, Callianassa filholi
affected a number of resource flows by its large lifetime per capita activity. Ecosystem effects were evident in
significant changes in macrofauna community composition over small spatial and temporal scales. Seasonal
variation in the effects of ghost shrimp activity were associated with changes in seagrass (*Zostera novazelandica*)
biomass, which revealed the probability of interactions between antagonistic ecosystem engineers. The formal
assessment of Callianassa filholi provides the opportunity to aid discussion pertaining to the development of the
ecosystem engineering concept.
