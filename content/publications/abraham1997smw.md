Seiche currents were observed in Wellington Harbour, New Zealand, with an Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler (ADCP). A 600 kHz Broad-Band ADCP was deployed on the sea bed in Evans Bay in an upwards looking configuration for 20 days. The measured seiche periods were 159, 26, 17.3, and 8.3 min and there was evidence for seiching at periods of 15.8 and 14.7 min. These observations are in close agreement with the previous predictions of a finite-difference numerical model. The seiching occurred during periods of wind with speeds in excess of 10 m s-1. The seiches were found to be barotropic.
