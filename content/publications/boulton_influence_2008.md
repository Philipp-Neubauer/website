The decline of avian populations in fragmented landscapes is often attributed to a decrease in nest survival rates for species breeding within these habitats. We tested whether fragment size and connectivity, livestock grazing, predator density or invertebrate biomass were correlated with nest survival rates for an endemic New Zealand species, the North Island robin (*Petroica longipes*). Across three breeding seasons (2002-2005) daily nest survival rate for the 203 robin nests monitored in 15 forest fragments was 0.315 (SE 0.003), with nest survival rates increasing with invertebrate biomass (indexed with pitfall traps) and marginally decreasing with fragment size. Footprint tracking rates for exotic ship rats (*Rattus rattus*), which are likely to be the key nest predator, varied greatly among fragments, but were not a useful predictor of nest survival. We found no relationship between the number of fledglings per successful nesting attempt and invertebrate biomass. We conclude that fragment size and connectivity does not appear to be negatively influencing robin nest survival, potentially because of the already high impact that mammalian nest predators have in this unique system.
