The surf clam toheroa (*Paphies ventricosa*) is
endemic to New Zealand, where it inhabits the intertidal
zone on exposed sandy beaches in North and South Island
regions. Toheroa are of great cultural importance, and have
a long history of supporting customary, recreational and
commercial fisheries. Owing to substantial population
declines, toheroa are currently only targeted in limited
customary fisheries.

The main toheroa populations in Southland are at Oreti and
Bluecliffs beaches, where they have been regularly
monitored since the late 1960s, including Ministry for
Primary Industries (MPI) surveys. The present report
documents the most recent MPI survey in Southland,
conducted in 2013–14 at Oreti, Bluecliffs, and
Orepuki beaches. The latter beach supports a small toheroa
population that has not been part of the regular surveys
before, but was the focus of a population study in 2008.

The primary aim of the survey was to estimate the
population of toheroa with shell lengths ≥40 mm. The
total population estimate for the population of these
toheroa at the three Southland beaches was 1 489 000 (95%
CI: 1 036 000–1 941 000) individuals in 2013–14.
Oreti Beach continued to support the largest toheroa
population in Southland, with an estimated population size
of 1 395 000 (95% CI: 951 000–1 840 000) toheroa
≥40 mm shell length at this beach. Of these toheroa,
an estimated 1 005 000 (95% CI: 644 000–1 367 000)
individuals were ≥100 mm shell length. In addition,
there were estimated to be 2 052 000 (95% CI:
755 000–348 000) juvenile toheroa (<40 mm shell length)
at Oreti Beach. The population of larger toheroa at Oreti
Beach appeared to be stable, with a similar estimated
number of toheroa at ≥100 mm shell length to that in a
previous survey in 2009 (980 000, 95% CI:
780 000–1 200 000); although this previous survey covered
a smaller area of the beach, excluding the area known as
the reserve. In contrast, the mean estimate of the number
of juvenile toheroa (<40 mm shell length) was around one
third the estimate from the 2009 survey (6 030 000, 95%
CI: 3 056 000–9 005 000).

A marked change at Oreti Beach was that gravel was noted in
many of the quadrats (23.8% of all quadrats, with no
gravel or stones recorded in 2009). The increase in the
occurrence of gravel may be associated with the decrease in
juvenile toheroa. This notion was supported by statistical
modelling of the number of toheroa within each quadrat at
Oreti Beach, which indicated a negative association between
counts of juvenile toheroa and the presence of gravel. A
negative association was also found between juvenile
toheroa and ghost shrimp burrow density. There was no
association between large toheroa and these habitat
characteristics.

Toheroa ≥40 mm shell length were present at high
densities at the southern end of the beach, close to the
entrance of New River Estuary, and also about 11–14
and 15–16 km along the beach; they were present at
low densities in other areas. Across the beach, individuals
in this size class were predominantly in the mid- to
low-intertidal zone. Juvenile toheroa also showed the
highest concentration in the southern part of Oreti Beach,
but their spatial distribution extended across the entire
intertidal zone, including the upper intertidal area in
this and other parts of the beach. The size-frequency
distribution of the Oreti Beach population was bimodal,
with a distinct cohort of juveniles and a second cohort of
individuals at shell lengths ≥80 mm. There were few
toheroa at intermediate sizes. The decrease in juvenile
toheroa at Oreti Beach may be related to episodic
recruitment. Nevertheless, if the number of juveniles
remains low, it would in turn lead to lower recruitment to
the adult population. In recent years, Bluecliffs Beach has
been eroded, and the toheroa population there was small,
with a total estimate of 65 000 (95% CI: 0–150 000)
toheroa ≥40 mm shell length in two disjunct areas,
including the western bay. The number of smaller juvenile
toheroa at Bluecliffs Beach was not estimated. Although the
sample size was small, the spatial distribution of toheroa
at Bluecliffs Beach appeared to extend across most of the
intertidal zone, from about 30 m distance from the toe of
the dune to the low tide mark. The size frequency
distribution was unimodal, with a strong cohort of
juveniles and few individuals at intermediate and large
sizes.

The toheroa population at Orepuki Beach was also small,
with an estimated 28 000 (95% CI: 10 000–46 000)
toheroa ≥40 mm shell length at this beach. The population at
this beach was dominated by juveniles, with 365 000 (95%
CI: 211 000–519 000) toheroa <40 mm shell length.
Toheroa were distributed along the entire survey area at
Orepuki Beach, with the distribution of large toheroa
restricted to the mid- and low-intertidal zone. In
contrast, the spatial distribution of juvenile toheroa
included the entire intertidal extent of the beach, other
than the upper intertidal zone (within 50 m of the toe of
the dune) in the northwestern part of the survey area.
Toheroa at Orepuki Beach had a unimodal size distribution
dominated by a strong cohort of juveniles, with few
individuals at ≥40 mm shell length.
