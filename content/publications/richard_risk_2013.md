{This report presents a risk assessment of the effect of fishing-related mortalities on 70 of the seabird species that breed in the New Zealand region. The assessment covers all fishing by commercial trawl, bottom-longline, surface-longline, and set-net fisheries within New Zealand's Exclusive Economic Zone. The risk was defined as the ratio of the estimated annual number of fatalities of birds due to bycatch in fisheries to the Potential Biological Removal (PBR), which is an estimate of the number of seabirds that may be killed without causing the population to decline below half the carrying capacity. The risk ratio for each seabird species is an estimate of the ratio between the number of fatalities due to fisheries bycatch, and the PBR. When estimating the PBR for each species, a recovery factor, f , should be specified. This recovery factor is typically between 0.1 and 0.5. It allows some protection against errors in estimating the PBR, and a lower value allows for a shorter recovery time for depleted populations. In this report, the risk ratio is calculated
