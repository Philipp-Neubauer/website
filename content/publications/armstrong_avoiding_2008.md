Habitat fragmentation can potentially have negative
impacts on many species because of both changes
in habitat quality associated with edge effects
(Saunders et al. 1991) and changes to population
dynamics caused by the loss of connectivity (Hanski
1998). The practical implication is that it may be
necessary to conserve a species in large continuous
areas of habitat, rather than in several small areas
(Burkey 1995), or to create corridors or stepping
stones between fragments (Hobbs 1992). However,
it is important that such management is based on
evidence, rather than a priori assumptions about
negative effects of fragmentation, and that the data
are interpreted carefully. Otherwise, the conservation
value of fragmented landscapes may be
underestimated, or extensive resources may be
invested in management that turns out to be
ineffective or even deleterious.
