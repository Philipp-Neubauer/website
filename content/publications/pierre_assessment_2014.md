Understanding the nature and extent of interactions between commercial
fisheries and marine protected species is one component of best practice
fisheries management.   These interactions can lead to mortalities of
protected species, which may be detected (e.g., by fisheries observers on
vessels), or not readily detectable, and undetected (also known as cryptic
mortalities). For seabirds, cryptic mortalities may result, for example, when
a bird carcass falls into the water after striking a trawl warp, or when
a bird is landed alive on deck, removed from fishing gear and released,
but later dies as a result of injuries sustained. The assessment of the risk
that New Zealand commercial fisheries represent to seabird populations,
conducted by Richard & Abraham (2013), considers cryptic mortality using
a set of multipliers applied across the various fishing methods. These scalars
are derived from sources including data collected in New Zealand and
internationally.

Here, we draw on Richard & Abraham's (2013) approach, updated in
2014, to identify seabird species and fisheries for which cryptic mortality
contributes particularly strongly to the overall assessed risk. We review
assumptions and uncertainties inherent in Richard & Abraham's (2014)
methods, as well as relevant new information which may contribute to the
development of more robust cryptic mortality scalars applicable to New
Zealand fisheries. Finally, we recommend options to improve the estimation
of cryptic mortality for the seabird species groups and fisheries where this
is particularly important.

From Richard & Abraham's (2014) assessment, cryptic mortality was
especially influential in determining overall assessed risk for both albatross
and petrel species, including black petrel (*Procellaria parkinsoni*) interacting
with small-vessel surface and bottom longline fisheries, and Salvin's (*Thalassarche salvini*) and New Zealand white-capped (*T. cauta steadi*)
albatross interacting with small inshore trawl vessels, and southern Buller's
albatross (*T. bulleri bulleri*) interacting with large trawl vessels with meal
plants.  Key assumptions included that cryptic mortality scalars derived
from fisheries outside New Zealand were appropriately applied to the
New Zealand context despite differences in seabird assemblages, fishing
operations and gear. Further, scalars applied to cryptic mortality of seabirds
due to aerial warp strikes and interactions with trawl nets were entirely
assumption-based.

Relevant new information that may contribute to refining scalars describing
cryptic mortality includes work conducted on cryptic mortality associated
with a Falkland Islands demersal trawl fishery, and two new studies
reporting the outcomes of seabird strikes on trawl warps. Additional data
sources that could prove valuable for the development of improved scalars
include the database collected on seabird interactions with trawl fisheries
in the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources Convention Area
and from trawl fisheries off the Falkland Islands. Given the seabirds and
fisheries for which cryptic mortality is a particularly important determinant
of overall risk, and the additional information that may be available, priority areas for improving estimates of cryptic mortalities in New Zealand
fisheries include developing method-specific cryptic mortality scalars for
boÄ´om longline fisheries, exploring existing information to refine scalars
applicable to inshore fisheries, and refining estimates of mortalities - both
observed and cryptic - that result from aerial warp strikes. Applying scalars
for broad groupings of large (i.e., predominantly albatrosses) and small
seabirds appears appropriate given current information. The immediate
amendment of data collection protocols used by New Zealand fisheries
observers is recommended to document cryptic seabird mortalities. The
implementation of new data collection protocols, potentially combined
with experimental data collection, are also considered priorities in order
to develop an understanding of cryptic mortality, especially in inshore
fisheries.
