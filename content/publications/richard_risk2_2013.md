This supplementary information presents a summary of population and distributional data for the 70
species included in the risk assessment of the impact of fishing-related mortalities on seabirds breeding
in the New Zealand region. For each seabird species included in the risk assessment, the demographic
parameters used were the New Zealand population size, the age at first reproduction, and the survival
rate. For species for which no demographic estimates were available, values from proxy species were
used, as indicated with a reference to the data source. Distributional data are presented as maps of the
at-sea distribution of each species, with separate maps for the non-breeding and breeding distributions.
The distribution of non-breeders was derived from existing maps published by NABIS (National Aquatic
Biodiversity Information System) and Birdlife International. A single distribution map was generated
when the breeding season extended throughout the year. Included in the distributional maps are data of
any incidental captures in commercial trawl, longline and set-net fisheries between the 2006–2007 and
2010–2011 fishing years, recorded by fisheries observers.

A detailed description of the methods used to derive the data presented here is provided in Section 2 of
the risk assessment.
