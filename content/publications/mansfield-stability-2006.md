Four aspects of rock-paper-scissors ecosystems are considered. In the first, the
effects of variations in the population’s spatial structure are described. With a
lattice-based spatial structure, three-species coexistence is unstable when dispersal
is long-range, but becomes stable at a critical threshold as the dispersal
distance is gradually reduced. A continuous-space model is constructed and
is shown to reproduce the three-species stability of the lattice model when interactions
are local. But unlike the lattice model, three-species coexistence can
be stable in the continuous space model even when dispersal is long-range.

In the second investigation, the pair approximation technique is applied to
the rock-paper-scissors system. The resulting equations fail to predict the stability
of the three-species state. A local structure approximation based on four
neighbouring sites is shown to produce a more accurate result.

The third contribution is the presentation of two models in which rock-paperscissors
is able to evolve from a simple two-species system. In both cases,
a two-species competitive cellular automaton is augmented with individual
variation in a phenotypic trait. In the first model, the trait determines the individual’s
investment in interspecific versus intraspecific competition, and in
the second model, the trait determines the individual’s investment in the production
of an interspecific toxin versus its growth rate. When interactions are
local, selection can cause a divergence in the values of both traits such that
only individuals with extreme levels of the trait survive, while those with
intermediate levels of the trait die out. After this divergence, the resulting
polymorphic community competes in an intransitive rock-paper-scissors cycle.

Finally, an assessment is made of the claim that competitive restraint in rockpaper-
scissors systems is caused by selection for stable subcommunities in a
process of community-level selection. It is argued that members of unstable
subcommunitiesmay be as fit or fitter than identical individuals in stable subcommunities,
and that the invocation of the higher-level selective force does
not add to the understanding of the process of competitive restraint. Measurements
of community stability in cellular automata models of rock-paperscissors
are undertaken and these provide no evidence for a community-level
selective force promoting restraint.
