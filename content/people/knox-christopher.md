Christopher is a web and software developer who specialises in data visualisation
– presenting large amounts of data in a graphical form.

Christopher enjoys being able to show clients their data in a way
that helps them make discoveries and solve real problems. 
Data visualisation – presenting large amounts of data in a graphical form – leverages the ability of people to rapidly hone 
in on relevant details, spot trends and isolate an issue. Christopher believes it 
is very efficient way to communicate information between analysts 
and decision makers. 

Creating visualisations draws on Christopher’s background in science and 
software development, enabling him to design and structure information in a 
scalable away. A recent project that had 28,000 possible views was built with 
robust automated systems and architecture that gave him confidence that every 
view would be correct. It was released to the public in a desktop format and as 
an app. 

Christopher has a PhD in physical chemistry from the University of Canterbury 
and completed two post-docs at the University of California Irvine.
Although he first dabbled in visualisation during his PhD, it was a chance
meeting with a group at Irvine that enabled him to enter the field. The group
were exploring large scale visualisation but were short of a physical
scientist.

> It was a great opportunity, so I stayed on and did a second post-doc. That led
me to a software engineering job with
[NVIDIA](http://www.nvidia.com/content/global/global.php) in Finland, where I
worked in their mobile business unit.

Moving to Saudi Arabia, Christopher took up a position using visualisation to
support research scientists at the [King Abdullah University of Science and
Technology](http://www.kaust.edu.sa/). These included chemists who were enabled
to virtually stand inside the molecules they were studying, and biologists using 
virtual reality techniques to explore
vast data sets. While at KAUST, Christopher  was part of the team that developed the 
[iDive](http://idivehousing.com/),
an underwater housing for the iPad that enables scientists to collect data electronically
underwater.

> People love seeing their data presented visually, but because it looks so good, 
it’s easy to be led astray or distracted by a feature that’s actually irrelevant. At 
Dragonfly, we always rigorously analyse the data before presenting it, and 
continually refine our work to be sure that any patterns we see are in fact real.
