Richard gained his PhD in Computer Science from Victoria University, applying
game theory to the study of ecological systems.

He was then employed at [Catalyst IT](http://catalyst.net.nz/) in Wellington
for five years as a web developer and programmer, primarily working on
[Mahara](https://mahara.org/), an open-source digital portfolio system. He
brings these specialised programming and database skills to Dragonfly Science. 

“Dragonfly Science use the same open source software that I’m very familiar
with from Catalyst, so the environments are closely aligned and we share
similar values. 

“The Mahara portfolio system was a groundbreaking project when we started. It
was funded by a group of universities who wanted to be able to share the
product freely, rather than have a single owner. It’s now used all over the
world. 

Electronic portfolios enable students to put together their work, such as web
content they have authored, into a showcase. Strict permissions for different
pages are built in, so different pages can be shared with different audiences — a
feature that many sites do not allow. 

“Dragonfly has a reputation for being able to deal with messy data and hard
problems. I’m looking forward to applying my programming and web development
expertise to the mix of skills we can offer our clients.”
