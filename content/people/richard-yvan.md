Yvan specialises in using the statistical computing software, R, to solve complex problems. 
<!--more-->

Since joining Dragonfly in 2010, Yvan has been working on seabird bycatch issues. 
This has included developing a seabird risk assessment, which considers interactions between
all New Zealand seabirds and fisheries in a consistent framework. This risk assessment is
used by the Ministry for Primary Industries to as a foundation for their management
of seabird bycatch issues. 

Yvan has broad experience with modern analysis techniques such as Bayesian analysis, 
and machine learning, spatial-analysis, and capture-recapture models. 
He is an expert at using the statistical software R, for generating data-driven
technical reports, and for displaying information simply and beautifully. These 
skills are sought after by a range of clients.

Yvan completed his undergraduate study at the University Pierre et Marie Curie
in Paris. His PhD and two-year post-doctoral fellowship were at Massey University 
in Palmerston North, where he studied North Island robins to understand
habitat fragmentation.

> I enjoy the lifestyle in New Zealand and the opportunity to do innovative
things and move forward. The job at Dragonfly has been full of challenge,
and I feel I'm doing something very useful. There's a great atmosphere here and
we have plenty of fun in the team. It's the best job.
