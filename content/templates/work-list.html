      <h1>What we do</h1>
        <p>
          We use statistical analysis so our clients can
        make decisions based on the best available information. Our speciality is modern 
        Bayesian methods, which allow uncertainty to be
      carried all the way through from analysis to decision making.

                <p> We built a prediction service for Immigration New Zealand, to allocate applications
                to different review streams, based on previous decisions. Appropriate handling of applications
                results in faster and more reliable decision making.
