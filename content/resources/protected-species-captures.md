Data on seabird, marine mammal, and turtle bycatch in New
Zealand waters is made available through an interactive website,
developed for the Ministry for Primary Industries.

Seabirds, marine mammals, and turtles are caught during commercial fishing
operations. In order to monitor the impacts of fishing on these species,
government observers on fishing vessels record any protected species bycatch
incidents that occur. Observer data on protected species captures are
maintained by the Ministry for Primary Industries, with identification of
captured animals carried out by the Department of Conservation. Data on
protected species captures in trawl and longline fisheries, from the 2002â€“03
fishing year onwards, are made available here.

Protected species bycatch is an issue that is of interest to many people,
including Government, fishing industry representatives, local orgnisations (such
as Forest & Bird), and international organisations (such as Birdlife International).
Making these data widely available helps create a common understanding of this
issue and allows stakeholders to explore for themselves which 
species are affected, and where the captures are occurring.
