Dragonfly has created an interactive web visualisation presenting information on population, employment, GDP and annual household income across the country's 66 territorial authorities for the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment (MBIE). The source data used for the visualisation are derived from Statistics New Zealand and MBIE data, and are available as CSV files from the MBIE website. The datasets include regional GDP by industry, household income, employment by industry, tourism origins and products, and population.
