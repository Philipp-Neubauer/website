The New Zealand pāua (abalone) fishery is a $50 million export industry. We 
carry out analysis of pāua fisheries on behalf of the Pāua Industry Council and the Ministry for Primary Industries,
providing the information they need for responsive, well-informed management of 
their sector.

##Information for sustainable fisheries
Good information is essential for the sustainable management of fisheries.
The Pāua Industry Council helps manage catch in New Zealand pāua fisheries, to 
ensure that the populations remain healthy. Pāua divers collect data on each individual dive. From this fishing data,
we are able to map the fishery and monitor its performance, reef by reef.

### Detailed information for sustainable pāua fisheries
Good information is essential for the sustainable management of fisheries. 
The Pāua Industry Council has developed dataloggers which attach to a diver’s wetsuit and record the position of each dive. 
By combining the fishing data with catch information, we are able to map the fishery and monitor its
performance, reef by reef.

### Daily catch data displayed
We built a web-based system, with each day’s catch data being uploaded
to a database, visualised, and mapped. Catch volumes in 
different locations can be displayed as coloured hexagons – green for an area that's performing well, and red for a not-so-good one. We also carry out the statistical
analysis needed to interpret the data, so it can be used to provide
a robust indicator of the health of the fishery.

##Statistical analysis supports decision making
Deciding whether to increase or decrease catches is a tough trade-off for fisheries. Decreasing catches puts 
short-term financial pressure on the fishers, but increasing catches may affect the longer-term sustainability.
We carry out the statistical
analysis needed to interpret the fisheries data, providing the advice the fishers need to balance profitability with the long term health of the population.

The statistical analysis is supported by a data management programme. The information is of high commercial
value to the fishers, and we have developed processes that maintain the privacy of individual
fisher’s data, while allowing high level summaries to be shared across the industry. The system
is deployed on the [Catalyst Cloud](http://www.catalyst.net.nz/catalyst-cloud), an 
affordable and secure New Zealand cloud computing service.

recognise the value that such detailed and timely information provides beyond 
their usual stock assessment process. Robust evidence of 
the state of the fishery will help ensure the sustainability of the fishery.
