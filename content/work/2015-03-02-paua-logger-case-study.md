summary: We built an automated system to upload, process and display daily pāua 
    catch data. This allows pāua fishers to manage their fishery sustainably and 
    reduce the time and cost of fishing.

The New Zealand pāua fishery is a $50 million export industry. We 
manage pāua fisheries data on behalf of the Pāua Industry Council, and 
provide the information they need for responsive, well-informed management of 
their sector.

##Detailed information for sustainable pāua fisheries
Good information is essential for the sustainable management of fisheries. 
The Pāua Industry Council has developed dataloggers which attach to a diver’s wetsuit and record the position of each dive. 
By combining the fishing data with catch information, we are able to map the fishery and monitor its
performance, reef by reef.

##Daily catch data displayed
We built a web-based system, with each day’s catch data being uploaded
to a database, visualised, and mapped. Catch volumes in 
different locations can be displayed as coloured hexagons – green for an area that's performing well, and red for a not-so-good one. We also carry out the statistical
analysis needed to interpret the data, so it can be used to provide
a robust indicator of the health of the fishery.

Security and integrity of the data are essential. The information is of high commercial
value to the fishers, and we have developed processes that maintain the privacy of individual
fisher’s data, while allowing high level summaries to be shared across the industry. The system
is deployed on the Catalyst Cloud, an 
affordable and secure New Zealand cloud computing service.

##Value for fishery managers 
The Ministry of Primary Industries is very positive about the project. They 
recognise the value that such detailed and timely information provides beyond 
their usual stock assessment process. Robust evidence of 
the state of the fishery will help ensure the sustainability of the fishery.
