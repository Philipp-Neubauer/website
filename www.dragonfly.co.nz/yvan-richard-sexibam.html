<p>A few packages already exist to simulate the dynamics of populations in fragmented landscapes. However, the movement of individuals between populations is generally over-simplified, whereas it is recognised as a major driver in the distribution and persistence of species.</p>
<p>For instance, we found that juveniles of North-Island robins (<i>Petroica longipes</i>) are very reluctant to cross more than 100 m of pasture during dispersal (see our methodology), and the landscape structure therefore needs to be taken into account if one wants to model the amount of movements between populations. Unfortunately, in metapopulation models, movements are often assumed to be independent of the matrix (the part of the landscape between habitat patches), and only dependent on the distance between habitat patches and on the size and/or quality of the patches.</p>
<p>For my PhD, I wanted a model that could be used to disentangle the relative effects of habitat quality and landscape connectivity on species persistence and distribution. To account for landscape connectivity, I wanted a realistic-yet-simple model of animal movement, which could be easily manipulated, and potentially applicable to other species and landscapes. Moreover, I wanted a flexible way of manipulating habitat quality via its impact on the species vital rates (productivity and adult/juvenile survival). </p>
<p>SEXIBAM is a program I wrote in C++ to model the dynamics of populations in fragmented landscapes. It is individually-based, i.e. the fate of each individual is modelled (both males and females): individuals reproduce, their juveniles disperse, settle in a territory, find a partner if possible, and eventually die, and each stage is controlled by parameters.
It is also spatially-explicit in the sense that patches and individuals occur in a specific landscape. Real or created maps (as rasters) of vegetation cover for example can be used.
Finally, it is a metapopulation model, because individuals are located in discrete habitat patches, either provided by the user or calculated using the program using the patch recognition function. During the simulations, the number of individuals in each patch is recorded for better insight into the whole dynamics at the landscape level.</p>

Two sets of 500 dispersal simulations each were run, keeping the distribution of total dispersal distances equal, but changing the gap crossing ability from 100 m to 150 m. All paths started from the central red point. The frequency of visits of each cell is represented by a gradient from blue (one or few visits) to red (many visits). </p>
