  <div class="squeeze-bottom"><p>A recent Aquatic Environment and Biodiversity Report estimates the number of seabirds captured during commercial fishing in New Zealand waters between 2002–03 and 2008–09. In New Zealand, government observers are present on some vessels and record any captures of seabirds and other protected species that occur. This study estimated the total numbers of seabirds that would have been reported if observers had been present on every fishing vessel. </p></div>
