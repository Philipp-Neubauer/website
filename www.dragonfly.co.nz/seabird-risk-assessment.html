<p>We assessed the risk to 70 species of seabirds from commercial fishing activity. This information has enabled decisions to be made about resource allocation and population management, despite uncertainties and limited data. </p>
<h3>Decline in seabird numbers</h3>
<p>New Zealand is the centre of seabird diversity worldwide, with approximately 85 species breeding on the three main islands and associated offshore islands. Many seabird species are threatened and, in some cases, bycatch in fisheries is thought to be a cause. Although qualitative information was available to show that seabirds are at risk from fishing, a quantitative analysis of that risk was lacking. There was concern that with limited time and resources, conservation efforts should be prioritised to species at greatest risk. </p>
<h3>Calculating a risk index</h3>
<p>Yvan Richard of Dragonfly Science was part of the team, including Dominique Filippi (Sextant Technology), and Ben Sharp (Ministry for Primary Industries) that carried out the risk-assessment. Yvan comments, “Our method was standardised across all species and made it easy to see which seabirds were most at risk, and which were not at risk. It also highlighted situations where there was a lack of data, both about the population and about interactions with fisheries.” </p>
<p>The assessment calculated a risk index for each species, from a ratio of the number of birds killed by fisheries each year to the PBR (Potential Biological Removals: the number of individuals that can be removed from a population without its viability being jeopardised).</p>
<h3>Modelling methods</h3>
<p>“The PBR method was originally developed for studying marine mammals. We used a range of analysis methods in this project, including Bayesian statistics, to consider uncertainties in parameters explicitly and rigorously, says Yvan. </p>
<p>“There was a huge variation in the population information available for different species, which was a challenge. We know a lot about very few species, and very little for most, often because they live in inaccessible places. Our model had to take account of some serious deficiencies in the data."</p>
<h3>Results</h3>

<p>The black petrel (<i>Procellaria parkinsoni</i>) was found to be the species most at risk, with the number of annual fishing-related fatalities estimated to be almost 20 times the PBR. This species is endemic to New Zealand and is classified as Vulnerable by the IUCN (IUCN 2010). Five other species were identified as being at "Very high risk".  Four species were considered at "High risk", nine at "Medium risk", seven at "Low risk", and the risk for the remaining 45 species was considered as negligible.</p>
<p>"Most of the observed black petrel captures were close to its breeding grounds in the Hauraki gulf. From 70 observed captures between 2006--07 and 2010--11, we estimated that between 1070 and 1900 birds may have potentially been killed each year, but the species' PBR was estimated to be between 47 and 117 mortalities per year. These results suggest that this species requires immediate management."</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"In assessing the risk of commercial fisheries to New Zealand's seabird populations, Dragonfly bridged the gap between science and its associated uncertainties, and policy and its inherent conflicts. They fostered an open and inclusive approach with all stakeholders".</p>
<p>"The assessment exercise has given us a new perspective on the risks posed by commercial fisheries, and in particular highlighted risks facing seabirds in New Zealand’s inshore fisheries."</p>
